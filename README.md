# Running the test network

Run `npm install` , after cloning the repo

`cd` into the `dist` folder to run the nodes

For now, there are 3 sample nodes

Run,
- `node miner1.js`
- `node miner2.js`
- `node miner3.js`

Connect each node with its peers [Option `1` in the CLI] before interacting with the blockchain

# About

A beginner blockchain that uses WebSocket to let nodes communicate with each other. As of writing, this project lacks a lot of functionalities that are considered desirable on a public working blockchain.
